-- A keyset page in link-id order, riding the primary key with no extra index;
-- the empty string starts from the beginning, a link_id never being empty. That
-- order means nothing to a reader: it is the page for a sweep that must see
-- every item exactly once, and a listing wants a sort-key page below.

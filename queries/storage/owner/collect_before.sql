-- The owner's manual collection of one mail collection below a date (§11.3):
-- every live item whose `date` is older than :before (RFC 3339 Z) and that
-- owes nothing, removed with its bindings, summary and addresses by cascade.
-- An item owes something while it is conflicted, a binding of it is
-- conflicted or has no base (a pending create), or its flags differ from a
-- binding's base flags, both known (an unpushed flag change); such an item
-- stays. An unknown `date` is never older. No tombstone and no push: the
-- remote keeps every member, and a widening relists them. Retained rows are
-- the purge's, not this. The cascade drops pins no statement returns, so
-- recompute_refcounts follows in the same transaction; the delete trigger
-- counts each row in `purges` (§4.5). Returns the seqs collected.

-- The deletes a round infers when its last page lands (SYNC.md §5): the
-- based bindings of this source that no page of the open round stamped,
-- whose item's `date` falls in the round's scope, or is unknown and the
-- round lists its whole scope. A band round lists by a date filter, which
-- never returns an undated member, so its absence there proves nothing. A
-- round whose listing a date filter narrowed (:narrowed 1, SYNC.md §4) proves
-- the absence only of what its filter could list: a member dated before the
-- round opened. An undated member, or one dated at or after that instant, is
-- absent there only when the connector enumerated the collection's handles
-- unfiltered (:enumerated 1, the enumeration in the `handles` slot) and that
-- enumeration lacks its handle. A pending create is no member of the remote
-- and is never listed here; a placement out of scope is not either, absence
-- meaning deleted only in scope. Read after the last page's own stamps, in
-- its write.

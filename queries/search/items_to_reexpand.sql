-- What a horizon roll or a change of time zone re-expands (§7), bound to the
-- horizon it replaces, the new one (the same twice when only a zone moved),
-- the version of the time zone database in use and the zone floating times
-- are read in: every live calendar item when either is not the one
-- index_meta records, since any zoned or floating time may move with it;
-- else a recurring series whose bound the old horizon had not reached, or
-- that states none, and a single calendar item whose start the new window
-- covers and the old one did not. The bound is compared on its calendar day,
-- the first eight characters of any UNTIL form against the date of the old
-- end, so a local or date-only UNTIL still compares.
